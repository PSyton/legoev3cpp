legoev3cpp
==========

This is a light-weight cross-platform C++11 API for remote control of the LEGO EV3. The current platform specicific  implementation files are only iOS bluetooth. This project is dependent on the ev3 sources with the minor header changes made in the dsjove fork (pull request has been made).
